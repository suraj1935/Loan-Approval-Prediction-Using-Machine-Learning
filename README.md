# Loan-Approval-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project uses a historical dataset of loan applicants with features such as gender, marital status, income, credit history, loan amount, and property area, among others. The goal is to build a machine learning model capable of predicting the loan approval status (approved or not approved) using these features.
